# Document Type: procedure_note

This document is a **procedure note** describing a clinical procedure or intervention.

Guidance:

- Focus on:
  - Name and type of procedure.
  - Indication for the procedure (why it was done).
  - Key steps, findings, and immediate outcome.
  - Complications (if any) and post-procedure instructions.
- Use the procedures section to document each procedure in structured form.

Constraints:

- `document_type` MUST be `"procedure_note"` in the JSON.
- Include at least one entry in `procedures` when the document clearly describes a procedure.
