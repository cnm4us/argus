# Document Type: external_specialist_note

This document is a **note from an external specialist** (outside the primary clinic or health system).

Guidance:

- Focus on:
  - Specialist’s assessment and plan related to their domain (e.g. cardiology, pulmonology, neurology).
  - Key findings from specialist exams, tests, or procedures.
  - Recommendations that impact the primary care plan or legal case.
- Capture how this note fits into the broader care (e.g. consultation summary, co-management plan).

Constraints:

- `document_type` MUST be `"external_specialist_note"` in the JSON.
- Use `encounter_type` to reflect the specialty (e.g. `"cardiology"`, `"pulmonology"`) when apparent.
