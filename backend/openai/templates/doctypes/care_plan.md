# Document Type: care_plan

This document is a **care plan or education note** outlining an ongoing management strategy.

Guidance:

- Focus on:
  - Long-term goals and key diagnoses.
  - Self-management instructions, lifestyle changes, and monitoring.
  - Planned follow-up visits, labs, or imaging.
  - Education provided to the patient or caregiver.
- Use the tags and keywords sections to capture high-level themes (e.g. `"COPD management"`, `"diabetes education"`).

Constraints:

- `document_type` MUST be `"care_plan"` in the JSON.
- `instructions` should summarize the main patient-facing advice in the plan.
