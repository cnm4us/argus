# Document Type: legal_document

This document is a **legal or administrative document** related to the case (e.g., attorney letter, claim form, legal summary).

Guidance:

- Focus on:
  - The legal context (e.g. malpractice claim, disability evaluation, insurance dispute).
  - Key allegations, timelines, or summaries of care.
  - Any explicit references to standard of care, negligence, or harm.
- Use risk flags conservatively; set them only when the document clearly supports them.

Constraints:

- `document_type` MUST be `"legal_document"` in the JSON.
- For `encounter_type`, a value like `"legal_consult"` or similar is acceptable when appropriate.
